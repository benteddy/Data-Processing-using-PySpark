# Data Processing using PySpark
This is the project to summarize the report of covid data from CSV file. The project uses PySpark to process the data from covid data in all countries per day into become a file report of top 20 cases per month.

## Prerequisites
This is the library you need to install.
- pyspark

## Getting Started
This project runs on Linux Ubuntu. To run PySpark, we need to install Apache Spark on Ubuntu. We can install Apache Spark manually from this link https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-apache-spark-on-ubuntu-debian/.

After installing Apache Spark on Ubuntu, we then install PySpark using pip. We run "pip install pyspark" to install PySpark in shell. After that, we can run the python script file in Ubuntu. Here is the python file.
